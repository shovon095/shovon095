# Hi, I'm Shouvon Sarker  

I am a researcher and developer working on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **Explainable AI**. My work focuses on building **trustworthy, interpretable, and efficient models** for structured reasoning tasks such as **Text-to-SQL** and **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**.  

My broader goal is to bridge the gap between **powerful black-box models** and **transparent AI systems** that humans can understand and trust.
