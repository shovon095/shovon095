About Me
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering with a research focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex natural language and data-driven applications. My work is centered on building transparent, trustworthy, and efficient AI systems for mission-critical domains, including Earth Science and Clinical NLP.

My core research interests include:

Explainable AI & Knowledge Distillation: Developing methods to make black-box models transparent and interpretable.

Text‑to‑SQL for Scientific Databases: Translating natural language questions into executable database queries for NASA's Earth Science data archives.

Clinical NLP: Extracting and classifying medication events from electronic health records to improve patient safety.

Generative AI & Trustworthiness: Building robust frameworks for generating and detecting machine-generated text, as recognized by the NIST GenAI Challenge.

News
August 2024: Our work on a generator-detector framework for trustworthy text generation placed in the Top 10% at the NIST GenAI 2024 Challenge.

June 2024: Presented our research, "Enhancing LLM Fine-Tuning for Text-to-SQL by SQL Quality Measurement," at IJCNN 2024.

August 2023: My paper, "Ensemble BERT for Medication Event Classification on EHRs," was published at the International Conference on Intelligent Biology and Medicine (ICIBM 2023).
