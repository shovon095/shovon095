## Research Overview

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at Prairie View A&M University, conducting research on **transparent, reliable, and trustworthy artificial intelligence systems** for mission-critical applications. My work focuses on improving the **interpretability, correctness, and robustness of large language models**, particularly in structured reasoning tasks and domain-specific settings.

My primary research interests include:

- Explainable and interpretable artificial intelligence  
- Large language models (LLMs) and structured generation  
- Text-to-SQL systems for scientific databases  
- Probabilistic error modeling and knowledge distillation  
- Clinical natural language processing  

**Current Academic Standing:** GPA 4.0 / 4.0
